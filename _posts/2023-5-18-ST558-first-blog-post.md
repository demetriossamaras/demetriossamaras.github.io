## This is my first blog post for ST 558
### 1. What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
### 2. What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
### 3. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  
### 4. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
1. I think that being a data scientist is primarily about synthesizing statistical methods and computer science to identify and solve problems. The benefit of this being the ability to leverage the power of both fields to develop tools to better work with complex data sets.
2. I see the most important knowledge areas that data scientists must have as being a competence in coding languages that can easily be used to develop analysis tools (R, Python, ect.), and a competence in statistical theory and implementation. 
3. Both data scientists and statisticians must have a solid foundation in statistical theory and methods, however data scientists can still be successful with less depth. Although coding and development are valuable skills for both, it is absolutely necessary for data scientists. 
4. At this point I see myself as a scientist first with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of statistics through this masters program to use as a tool to more effectively analyze data in research. However, I think that if I were to look for a job in one of the two fields I may prefer data science because of the development aspect.
