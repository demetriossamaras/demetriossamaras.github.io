### Once you’ve completed your vignette you should write a brief blog post:

- explaining what you did in the project and any interesting findings  
- You should also reflect on the process you went through for this
  project. Discuss things like:
  - what was the most difficult part of the logic and programming for
    you?
  - what would you do differently in approaching a similar project in
    the future?

For this first project for ST558 the goal was to create a set of
functions that could contact, retrieve and parse data from one of a set
of API’s. I chose the Pokemon API because it had a large number of
endpoints and could be used to get a lot of data that was easy to work
with. I think the most interesting finding was how there were some
differences in how Pokemon heights and weights seemed to be distributed
based on

At first, I really struggled with this project and how to even get
started. I had trouble understanding what an endpoint really meant and
was struggling to understand what to do with the response once I had it.
After getting some help for those issues the rest of the project was not
too bad. I think the hardest part of the logic was trying to get the
functions to take a vector as an input without breaking or returning a
mess. If I were to do a similar project in the future, I would probably
assess how much functionality I really needed and try to meet that more
efficiently. I spent a lot of time trying to allow the user to input a
vector containing both id’s and vectors when that wasn’t necessarily a
requirement of the projects. Overall I think I learned a lot with this
project and feel much more comfortable with R after doing it.
