### We are done learning about how to program in R (and now we are looking at fitting models and other fun stuff). Write a post about what you consider the coolest thing youâ€™ve learned about programming in R. Include an example of it (or at least the code to do it) in your post (for instance, if it was ggplot you could read in a data set and create a cool plot).

So far there have been a lot of cool things that we have learned how to
do in R. I think that for me the most interesting thing that we have
learned how to do is write functions. I think that the ability to make
something that is essentially a tool to do a job is really cool. My
favorite type is the `apply` family of functions because it allows you
to loop through your function using whatever values you want to run the
function of interest rather than running it a bunch of times. Here is an
example of an apply function and its output.

``` r
## runs this function on the first 100 integers 
example <- sapply(1:100, function(i){
  ## checks if even 
  if((i %% 2) == 0) {
    n<- i/2
  } 
  ## checks if odd
  if((i %% 2)!= 0){
    n <- 3*i+1
  }
  n
}
)

example
```

    ##   [1]   4   1  10   2  16   3  22   4  28   5  34   6  40   7  46   8  52   9
