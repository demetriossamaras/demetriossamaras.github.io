# I am in a statistics Masters Program and this blog was created for my ST 558 class.  

## It will primarily be used for the following 

1. Assignments  
    + Creating posts
    + Fiddling with files and settings to learn about how they work  
2. Other stuff like
    + A picture of my dog (**still part of an assignment**)
