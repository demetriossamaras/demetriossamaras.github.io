## Programming Background prompt

#### Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you’ve used? What functionality do you like about R? What parts do you miss about your other language? Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

I think I managed to sneak into this course without knowing about the
prerequisite that is being referenced, so I have a very limited
background with programming. The only experience I have is the small
amount of C that I did in my Unix course as a freshman electrical
engineering major in 2014. Considering it only took me a third of a
semester working with C to switch my major to microbiology, my thoughts
on R compared to C are very positive haha. The thing that I like the
most about R is that it is incredibly easy to get functions and tools
that other people have made, and the syntax is much more
straightforward. I did not get very far into C so there isn’t anything
that I miss, but now that I am more mature, I may want to revisit C
because I know that it is a valuable language to know. For me R has been
challenging so far to learn because I do not have a lot of background,
but I think I have been slowly getting a better understanding of it and
(with a lot of help) been doing well in the course so far.
